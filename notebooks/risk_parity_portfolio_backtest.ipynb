    "### 5. Calculate Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "In financial analysis, one of the key metrics is the return on an investment, <br>\n",
    "which shows how much the price of an asset has increased or decreased over a <br>\n",
    "certain period. I calculate the **arithmetic returns** of the adjusted close prices <br>\n",
    "to measure this change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Calculate Arithmetic Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Arithmetic Returns:**\n",
    "   - Arithmetic returns measure the percentage change in the price of an asset <br>\n",
    "   from one period to the next. \n",
    "   - The formula for calculating the arithmetic return for a given period is:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     R_t = \\frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - $ R_t $ is the return at time $ t $,\n",
    "     - $ P_t $ is the price at time $ t $,\n",
    "     - $ P_{t-1} $ is the price at the previous time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This formula can be simplified to:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     R_t = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - However, in practice, it is common to use the percentage change function <br>\n",
    "   provided by Pandas, which handles this calculation efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Percentage Change**\n",
    "3. **Handle Missing Values:**\n",

    "By following these steps, I will have a series of arithmetic returns that <br>\n",

    "### 6. Compute Risk-Parity Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk-parity is an investment strategy that seeks to allocate portfolio weights <br>\n",
    "in a way that each asset contributes equally to the overall portfolio risk. <br>\n",
    "This method is especially useful in diversifying risk across different assets <br>\n",
    "with varying levels of volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Compute Risk-Parity Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Risk-Parity:**\n",
    "   - The idea behind risk-parity is to allocate more weight to less volatile <br>\n",
    "   assets and less weight to more volatile assets, thereby equalizing the risk <br>\n",
    "   contribution of each asset in the portfolio.\n",
    "   - The weight of each asset in the portfolio is inversely proportional to its <br>\n",
    "   volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Rolling Volatility:**\n",
    "   - Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a <br>\n",
    "   given security or market index.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. **Compute Inverse Volatility:**\n",
    "4. **Normalize Weights:**\n",
    "   - Once I have the inverse volatilities, I normalize them so that the sum of <br>\n",
    "   the weights for each time period equals 1. This ensures a proper weight distribution <br>\n",
    "   across assets.\n",
    "   - I achieve this by dividing the inverse volatility of each asset by the <br>\n",
    "   sum of the inverse volatilities across all assets for each time period.\n",
    "     \n",
    "5. **Shift Weights for Practical Application:**\n",
    "   - In a real-world scenario, I can only make investment decisions based on <br>\n",
    "   information that is available at the time of making the decision. Therefore, <br>\n",
    "   I shift the computed weights by one period to ensure that the weights at <br>\n",
    "   time $ t $ are based on data up to $ t-1 $.      \n",
    "   - This shift ensures that the weights applied are based on historical data <br>\n",
    "   up to the previous period, which is crucial for avoiding look-ahead bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, I generate a time series of risk-parity weights that <br>\n",
    "can be used to allocate assets in a way that balances the risk across the portfolio. <br>\n",
    "The resulting weights adapt dynamically based on the rolling volatility, ensuring <br>\n",
    "that each asset contributes equally to the overall risk over time.\n"

    "This process allows me to understand how the risk-parity allocation strategy <br>\n",
    "would have performed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Calculate Weighted Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Weighted Returns:**\n",
    "   - The weighted return of an asset is calculated by multiplying its individual <br>\n",
    "   return by the corresponding weight in the portfolio. \n",
    "   - The total portfolio return at any given time is the sum of the weighted <br>\n",
    "   returns of all assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply Weights to Returns:**\n",
    "   - I will multiply the returns of each asset by its corresponding risk-parity <br>\n",
    "   weight for each time period. This will give us the weighted return for each asset.\n",
    "3. **Handle Missing Data:**\n",
    "   - I drop any rows with missing values (`NaN`) that may result from the <br>\n",
    "   multiplication process. This ensures that I only consider time periods with <br>\n",
    "   complete data.\n",
    "4. **Aggregate Weighted Returns:**\n",
    "   - To calculate the portfolio's return at each time period, sum the weighted <br>\n",
    "   returns across all assets. This gives the overall return of the portfolio <br>\n",
    "   for each time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the returns $ r_{i,t} $ for asset $ i $ at time $ t $, and the <br>\n",
    "risk-parity weight $ w_{i,t} $ for asset $ i $ at time $ t $, the <br>\n",
    "weighted return for asset $ i $ at time $ t $ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ r_{i,t}^{weighted} = r_{i,t} \\times w_{i,t} $\n",

    "The total portfolio return at time $ t $ is the sum of the weighted returns for <br>\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ n $ is the number of assets in the portfolio.\n",

    "By following these steps, I obtain the portfolio returns that reflect the <br>\n",
    "performance of the risk-parity strategy over time. This provides insights into <br>\n",
